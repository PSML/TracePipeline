This code is copied from the torch nn documentation & modified: https://github.com/torch/nn/blob/master/doc/training.md. I plan to model my first network on it. 

xor.lua - the simplest possible cpu network.
xorGPU.lua - my slight adaptation to run on a gpu. I don't know if there is a more elegant way, but it seems to work.
