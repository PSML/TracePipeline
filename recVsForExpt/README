This will contain code for running bmp data through a simple feed forward network. This is really just a sanity check. Obviously this sytle of nn will be major overkill. From looking at the trace data, the for loop traces can actually be told apart from the recursive data with a single bit! Consider this nothing more than a confidence booster.
